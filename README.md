# SPY game Telegram bot (in development)

## Short description
A telegram bot for spy game.
Want to play with your friends? Message [@rpg_spy_bot](http://t.me/rpg_spy_bot) in telegram.

## Goal of the game
As soon as the game starts there will be 2 types of players (spies and players).
Every non-spy player will be given the information about location.
Goal of a spy is to guess the location untill the end of a game.
Goal of a player is to find out who is the spy.

## Rules ðŸ“Œ
1) As soon as the game starts in a group chat, bot should periodically ask 1 player at a time 2 things:
    - Who do you want to ask a question
    - Your question

2) Each time only the person who was asked the question should answer it, soon after the person who answered, should be next to ask a question.

3) This cycle repeats until the estimated time runs out, and then all players should leave their vote in the pole with player names.

4) The person who gets most votes gets eliminated (if a player was a spy, players win. Otherwise spies win and players loose).
