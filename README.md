# SPY game Telegram bot (in development)

## Short description
A telegram bot for spy game.
Want to play it with your friends? Message [@rpg_spy_bot](http://t.me/rpg_spy_bot) in telegram.

## Goal of the game
The game will have 2 types of players - spies and regular players.
 Non-spy players will be given the location information, while the goal of the spies is to guess the location before the game ends. 
The players' objective is to determine who the spies are.

## Rules ðŸ“Œ
1) When the game starts in a group chat, bot will periodically ask each player at a time 2 questions:
    - Who will they choose to answer their question.
    - What is their question.

2) Each question should be answered by the person it was directed to, and that person should then ask their own question. 

3) This cycle repeats until the estimated time is reached, then all players should leave their vote in the pole with player names.

4) The player with most votes gets eliminated (if a player was a spy, players win. Otherwise it's a spies' win).
